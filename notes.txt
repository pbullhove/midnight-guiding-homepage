# CSS

In order to get a scroll bar when too large for the box: 
overflow: auto

In order to have the scale of the border and padding not increase the size of the box:
box-sizing: border-box. 
(Do this for all elements. )

To get a span to respect width and heigth: 
display: inline-block


Absolute positioning:
then it's like it's on another layer, and will not affect the others. 

Do mobile-first development: then resize for larger screens. 

@media screen and (min-width: 600) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}

Should Sprite your logos and icons. Reduce the number of http requests your images will be gotten with one http request instead of one GET for every image. 
- cssspritestool.com
- will then have one png image with all your icons. 
- and you apply some css code that is also generated, to get the specific locations for that image. 
- should use spans with background-image to display these sprites. 
- should not combine big images (like photos of people, not very flexible)
- use this for small images like locos and icons. 

Very small and simple icons can ge put directly into your html code. 
- Search for data uri generator. 
- This generates a string that represents your icon. Then embed this directly into img. 
- <img alt="" src="data:image/png";base64..."/>
- Dont use this though, slow on mobile. 


Can clip / crop images directly in css.
- find the code with css clip maker online tools. 
- clip-path: polygon(...)

Can also apply filters directly in css. 
- can be applied on hover, which is pretty cool. 
- like all images are grayscale, and color on the one that you hover over.
